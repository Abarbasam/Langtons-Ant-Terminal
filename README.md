# Langtons-Ant-Terminal
A simple Langton's Ant script that runs in your terminal. It does not show the final product immediately, but rather each step of the ant. The 2D array that the ant is using to step on is self-expanding, meaning you can have the ant take as many steps as you like without getting an out-of-range error
